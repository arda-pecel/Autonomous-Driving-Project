# Autonomous-Driving-Project
Autonomous driving project is a control software started at September 2022 and developing with Python and can be used for autonomous vehicle's.<br>
For object detection train Augelab Studio is used which is an open source image processing compiler. Dataset contains 16.185 images of 196 classes of cars.
Raspberry pi 4 is used for communication with Augelab Studio and getting location informations.

## Image Processing Results
16.185 images processed for car detections with more than 2000 iterations.<br> 
Current avg loss: less than 0.03 (less than 1.0 gives accurate results)<br>
