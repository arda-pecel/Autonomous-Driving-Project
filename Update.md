## V0.2 Update:<br>
Strip positions will be checked after strip changes.<br>
Other cars velocity, positions and acceleration considered in the strip changes.<br>
In current situation software catchs only one car in the screen. Also distance measurement between other cars does not working properly. (some problems at dark colour cars for night drivings) <br>
Test code has some repetitive functions and has to be optimized.
