## V0.3 Update:<br>
Cameras communicate with each other for detect objects.

System can detect more than one car simultaneously.

## V0.2 Update:<br>
Image Compressor method added for reduce memory usage on computer. This method uses linear algebra to compress image.

Other cars velocity, positions and acceleration considered in the strip changes. (still have some problems but software can seperate parking cars)<br>

System can seperate are cars in our or in opposite line.<br>

Test code still has some repetitive functions.<br>

Red lights detected and vehicle moves due to traffic lights and other cars.<br>

Motor control code has not integrated with engine.

## V0.1 Update:<br>

In current situation software catchs only one car in the screen. Also distance measurement between other cars does not working properly. (some problems at dark colour cars for night drivings) <br>

It does not effect the control system but system can not seperate moving and parking cars.<br>

Strip positions will be checked after strip changes.<br>

Test code has some repetitive functions and has to be optimized.
