## V0.2 Update:<br>
Image Compressor method added for reduce memory usage on computer. This method uses linear algebra to compress image.
In current situation software catchs only one car in the screen. Also distance measurement between other cars does not working properly. (some problems at dark colour cars for night drivings) <br>
Test code still has some repetitive functions.

## V0.1 Update:<br>
Strip positions will be checked after strip changes.<br>
Other cars velocity, positions and acceleration considered in the strip changes. (still have some problems)<br>
Test code has some repetitive functions and has to be optimized.
